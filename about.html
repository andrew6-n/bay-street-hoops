<h4>HISTORY</h4>
<br>

<p>The first Bay Street Hoops tournament was held in 1995 and was mostly about basketball. With eight law firm teams and less than $10,000 in proceeds, we never imagined it would get much bigger.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, the tournament grew. People loved the tournament and teams from all areas of Bay Street were signing up. We realized we had hit on a great idea.</p>

<p>It was then that we decided that the tournament should be about more than just basketball. It should also be about giving back to the community.</p>

<p>As we started focus equally on basketball and community, we also made the decision to engage directly with the groups we were supporting.</p>

<p>We chose to focus on smaller children and youth charities. We wanted them to be part of the Hoops committee and the tournament. We wanted to be part of the chosen organizations. We wanted to experience the impact our efforts had on the children and youth.</p>

<p>Today, Bay Street Hoops features close to 50 teams, divided into six men&rsquo;s divisions and one women&rsquo;s divisions, representing all skill levels. Last year, more than 600 players from Toronto&rsquo;s leading law and accounting firms, financial services companies and other corporations, as well as hundreds of spectators and volunteers, attended the tournament and its related events.</p>

<p>Since 1995, more than $2.4 million has been raised for children and youth charities in the Toronto area, including $110,000 in 2014.</p>
